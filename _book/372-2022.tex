\section{Course Objectives and Learning Outcomes}\label{course-objectives-and-learning-outcomes}}

This course is designed to introduce to data science. Students will apply statistical knowledge and techniques to both business and non-business contexts.

At the end of this course students should be able to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Demonstrate mastery of the statistical software in R and the Rstudio IDE.
\item
  Data wrangle (the process of cleaning and unifying messy and complex data sets for easy access and analysis)
\item
  Demonstrate mastery of single and multiple regression.
\item
  Demonstrate mastery of these dplyr functions: filter, select, mutate, group\_by, summaize, and tally.
\item
  Demonstrate mastery of how business analytics is related to other business functions and is important to the success of the business entity.
\end{itemize}

This course will be focused on both understanding and applying key business analytical concepts. Although the text serves as a useful foundation for the concepts covered in the class, simple memorization of the material in the text will not be sufficient. Class participation, discussion, and application are critical.

\hypertarget{class-participation}{%
\section{Class Participation:}\label{class-participation}}

I will frequently give readings or assignments for you to complete prior to the next class meeting. I expect you to fully engage the material: answer questions, pose questions, provide insightful observations. Keep in mind that quality is an important component in ``participation.'' Periodic cold calls will take place. I will also put students in the ``hot seat'' on occasion. In these class sessions, I may select a random group of students to lead us in the discussion and debate. Because the selection of participants will not be announced until class begins, everyone will be expected to prepare for the discussion. Reading the assigned chapters and articles are the best way to prepare for the discussion. If you have concerns about being called on in class, please see me to discuss. The purpose of the ``hot seat'' is not to stress or embarrass students, but to encourage students to actively engage the material.

\hypertarget{phones}{%
\section{Phones}\label{phones}}

\textbf{Phones are not allowed to be used in class without the instructor's prior consent.} If you have a need of a phone during class please let me know before class. Unauthorized use of electronic devices may result in the lowering of the grade or dismissal from the class. \textbf{I mean this.}

\hypertarget{attendance}{%
\section{Attendance}\label{attendance}}

You are expected to be regular and punctual in your class attendance. Students are responsible for all the material missed and homework assignments made. If class is missed, notes/homework should be obtained from another student. If I am more than 15 minutes late, class is considered cancelled. No more than 4 absences are allowed during a semester. Exceeding the absence policy may result in receiving an F for the course. The professors roll is the official roll and students not present when roll is taken will be counted as absent. If a student must miss an exam, she or he must work out an agreeable time with the instructor to take the test prior to the exam being given. If a student misses a test due to an emergency, the student must inform the instructor as soon as is possible. In special cases, the instructor may allow the student to take a make-up exam.

\hypertarget{accommodations}{%
\section{Accommodations}\label{accommodations}}

Presbyterian College is committed to providing reasonable accommodations for all students with documented disabilities. If you are seeking academic accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, you must register with the Academic Success Office, located on 5th Avenue (beside Campus Police). To receive these accommodations, please obtain the proper Accommodations Approval Form from that office, and then meet with me at the beginning of the semester to discuss how we may deliver your approved accommodations. I especially encourage you to meet with me well in advance of the actual accommodations being provided, as it may not be feasible to offer immediate accommodations without sufficient advance notice (such as in the case of tests). I can assure you that all discussions will remain confidential. Disability Services information is located at this link \url{http://bit.ly/PCdisabilityservices}

Additionally, it is the student's responsibility to give the instructor one week's notice prior to each instance where accommodation will be required.

\hypertarget{honor-code-and-plagiarism}{%
\section{Honor Code and Plagiarism:}\label{honor-code-and-plagiarism}}

All assignments/exams must be your own work. Any copying or use of unauthorized assistance will be treated as a violation of PC's Honor Code. If you are unsure of what resources are allowed, please ask. Please note that all text longer than 7 words taken from ANY other source must be placed in quotations and cited. Also, summarizing ANY other source must also be cited. Using ANY other source and showing work to be your own is a violation of plagiarism and the honor code.

\chapter{Data Science Overview}\label{data-science-overview}}

\textbf{Analytics} is the systematic computational analysis of data or statistics.

It is used for the discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in data. It also entails applying data patterns towards effective decision-making.

It can be valuable in areas rich with recorded information; analytics relies on the simultaneous application of statistics, computer programming and operations research to quantify performance.

Organizations may apply analytics to business data to describe, predict, and improve business performance.

Specifically, areas within analytics include predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics, enterprise decision management, descriptive analytics, cognitive analytics, Big Data Analytics, retail analytics, supply chain analytics, store assortment and stock-keeping unit optimization, marketing optimization and marketing mix modeling, web analytics, call analytics, speech analytics, sales force sizing and optimization, price and promotion modeling, predictive science, graph analytics, credit risk analysis, and fraud analytics.

Since analytics can require extensive computation (think: big data), the algorithms and software used for analytics harness the most current methods in computer science, statistics, and mathematics.

\href{https://rpubs.com/hadley/ggplot2-layers}{link}

\hypertarget{mapping}{%
\section{mapping}\label{mapping}}

A set of aesthetic mappings, specified using the aes() function and combined with the plot defaults as described in aesthetic mappings. If NULL, uses the default mapping set in ggplot().

\hypertarget{data}{%
\section{data}\label{data}}

A dataset which overrides the default plot dataset. It is usually omitted (set to NULL), in which case the layer will use the default data specified in ggplot(). The requirements for data are explained in more detail in data.

\hypertarget{geoms}{%
\section{Geoms}\label{geoms}}

The name of the geometric object to use to draw each observation. Geoms are discussed in more detail in geom, and the toolbox explores their use in more depth.

\hypertarget{geoms-1}{%
\section{Geoms}\label{geoms-1}}

can have additional arguments. All geoms take aesthetics as parameters. If you supply an aesthetic (e.g.~colour) as a parameter, it will not be scaled, allowing you to control the appearance of the plot, as described in setting vs.~mapping. You can pass params in \ldots{} (in which case stat and geom parameters are automatically teased apart), or in a list passed to geom\_params.

\hypertarget{stat}{%
\section{stat}\label{stat}}

The name of the statistical tranformation to use. A statistical transformation performs some useful statistical summary is key to histograms and smoothes. To keep the data as is, use the ``identity'' stat. Learn more in statistical transformations.

You only need to set one of stat and geom: every geom has a default stat, and every stat a default geom.

Most stats take additional parameters to specify the details of statistical transformation. You can supply params either in \ldots{} (in which case stat and geom parameters are automatically teased apart), or in a list called stat\_params.

\hypertarget{position}{%
\section{position}\label{position}}

The method used to adjusting overlapping objects, like jittering, stacking or dodging. More details in position.

\hypertarget{about}{%
\chapter{About}\label{about}}

\begin{quote}
Originally from the default index.
\end{quote}

This is a \emph{sample} book written in \textbf{Markdown}. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports; for example, a math equation \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\).

\hypertarget{usage}{%
\section{Usage}\label{usage}}

Each \textbf{bookdown} chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter \emph{must} start with a first-level heading: \texttt{\#\ A\ good\ chapter}, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading.

Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: \texttt{\#\#\ A\ short\ section} or \texttt{\#\#\#\ An\ even\ shorter\ section}.

The \texttt{index.Rmd} file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book.

\hypertarget{render-book}{%
\section{Render book}\label{render-book}}

You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Find the \textbf{Build} pane in the RStudio IDE, and
\item
  Click on \textbf{Build Book}, then select your output format, or select ``All formats'' if you'd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files.
\end{enumerate}

Or build the book from the R console:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{bookdown}\SpecialCharTok{::}\FunctionTok{render\_book}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To render this example to PDF as a \texttt{bookdown::pdf\_book}, you'll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): \url{https://yihui.org/tinytex/}.

\hypertarget{preview-book}{%
\section{Preview book}\label{preview-book}}

As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in ``Preview book'', or from the R console:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{bookdown}\SpecialCharTok{::}\FunctionTok{serve\_book}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{hello-bookdown}{%
\chapter{Hello bookdown}\label{hello-bookdown}}

All chapters start with a first-level heading followed by your chapter title, like the line above. There should be only one first-level heading (\texttt{\#}) per .Rmd file.

\hypertarget{a-section}{%
\section{A section}\label{a-section}}

All chapter sections start with a second-level (\texttt{\#\#}) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter.

\hypertarget{an-unnumbered-section}{%
\subsection*{An unnumbered section}\label{an-unnumbered-section}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{An unnumbered section}

Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a \texttt{\{.unnumbered\}} or the shorter \texttt{\{-\}} at the end of the heading, like in this section.

\hypertarget{cross}{%
\chapter{Cross-references}\label{cross}}

Cross-references make it easier for your readers to find and link to elements in your book.

\hypertarget{chapters-and-sub-chapters}{%
\section{Chapters and sub-chapters}\label{chapters-and-sub-chapters}}

There are two steps to cross-reference any heading:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Label the heading: \texttt{\#\ Hello\ world\ \{\#nice-label\}}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, \texttt{\#\ Hello\ world} = \texttt{\#\ Hello\ world\ \{\#hello-world\}}.
  \item
    To label an un-numbered heading, use: \texttt{\#\ Hello\ world\ \{-\#nice-label\}} or \texttt{\{\#\ Hello\ world\ .unnumbered\}}.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \texttt{\textbackslash{}@ref(nice-label)}; for example, please see Chapter \ref{cross}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: \protect\hyperlink{cross}{any text you want can go here}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{captioned-figures-and-tables}{%
\section{Captioned figures and tables}\label{captioned-figures-and-tables}}

Figures and tables \emph{with captions} can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \texttt{\textbackslash{}@ref(fig:chunk-label)} and \texttt{\textbackslash{}@ref(tab:chunk-label)}, respectively.

See Figure \ref{fig:nice-fig}.

\begin{Shaded}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\hypertarget{parts}{%
\chapter{Parts}\label{parts}}

You can add parts to organize one or more book chapters together. Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file.

Add a numbered part: \texttt{\#\ (PART)\ Act\ one\ \{-\}} (followed by \texttt{\#\ A\ chapter})

Add an unnumbered part: \texttt{\#\ (PART\textbackslash{}*)\ Act\ one\ \{-\}} (followed by \texttt{\#\ A\ chapter})

Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: \texttt{\#\ (APPENDIX)\ Other\ stuff\ \{-\}} (followed by \texttt{\#\ A\ chapter}). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers.

\hypertarget{footnotes-and-citations}{%
\chapter{Footnotes and citations}\label{footnotes-and-citations}}

\hypertarget{footnotes}{%
\section{Footnotes}\label{footnotes}}

Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret \texttt{\^{}{[}{]}}. Like this one \footnote{This is a footnote.}.

\hypertarget{citations}{%
\section{Citations}\label{citations}}

Reference items in your bibliography file(s) using \texttt{@key}.

For example, we are using the \textbf{bookdown} package \citep{R-bookdown} (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and \textbf{knitr} \citep{xie2015} (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib).
Note that the \texttt{.bib} files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML \texttt{bibliography} key.

The \texttt{bs4\_book} theme makes footnotes appear inline when you click on them. In this example book, we added \texttt{csl:\ chicago-fullnote-bibliography.csl} to the \texttt{index.Rmd} YAML, and include the \texttt{.csl} file. To download a new style, we recommend: \url{https://www.zotero.org/styles/}

The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: \url{https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/\#/citations}

\hypertarget{blocks}{%
\chapter{Blocks}\label{blocks}}

\hypertarget{equations}{%
\section{Equations}\label{equations}}

Here is an equation.

\begin{equation} 
  f\left(k\right) = \binom{n}{k} p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}
  \label{eq:binom}
\end{equation}

You may refer to using \texttt{\textbackslash{}@ref(eq:binom)}, like see Equation \eqref{eq:binom}.

\hypertarget{theorems-and-proofs}{%
\section{Theorems and proofs}\label{theorems-and-proofs}}

Labeled theorems can be referenced in text using \texttt{\textbackslash{}@ref(thm:tri)}, for example, check out this smart theorem \ref{thm:tri}.

\begin{theorem}
\protect\hypertarget{thm:tri}{}\label{thm:tri}For a right triangle, if \(c\) denotes the \emph{length} of the hypotenuse
and \(a\) and \(b\) denote the lengths of the \textbf{other} two sides, we have
\[a^2 + b^2 = c^2\]
\end{theorem}

Read more here \url{https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html}.

\hypertarget{callout-blocks}{%
\section{Callout blocks}\label{callout-blocks}}

The \texttt{bs4\_book} theme also includes special callout blocks, like this \texttt{.rmdnote}.

You can use \textbf{markdown} inside a block.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{head}\NormalTok{(beaver1, }\AttributeTok{n =} \DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{)}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{}   day time  temp activ}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} 1 346  840 36.33     0}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} 2 346  850 36.34     0}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} 3 346  900 36.35     0}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} 4 346  910 36.42     0}
\CommentTok{\#\textgreater{} 5 346  920 36.55     0}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

It is up to the user to define the appearance of these blocks for LaTeX output.

You may also use: \texttt{.rmdcaution}, \texttt{.rmdimportant}, \texttt{.rmdtip}, or \texttt{.rmdwarning} as the block name.

The R Markdown Cookbook provides more help on how to use custom blocks to design your own callouts: \url{https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/custom-blocks.html}

\hypertarget{sharing-your-book}{%
\chapter{Sharing your book}\label{sharing-your-book}}

\hypertarget{publishing}{%
\section{Publishing}\label{publishing}}

HTML books can be published online, see: \url{https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/publishing.html}

\hypertarget{pages}{%
\section{404 pages}\label{pages}}

By default, users will be directed to a 404 page if they try to access a webpage that cannot be found. If you'd like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a \texttt{\_404.Rmd} or \texttt{\_404.md} file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax.

\hypertarget{metadata-for-sharing}{%
\section{Metadata for sharing}\label{metadata-for-sharing}}

Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the \texttt{index.Rmd} YAML. To setup, set the \texttt{url} for your book and the path to your \texttt{cover-image} file. Your book's \texttt{title} and \texttt{description} are also used.

This \texttt{bs4\_book} provides enhanced metadata for social sharing, so that each chapter shared will have a unique description, auto-generated based on the content.

Specify your book's source repository on GitHub as the \texttt{repo} in the \texttt{\_output.yml} file, which allows users to view each chapter's source file or suggest an edit. Read more about the features of this output format here:

\url{https://pkgs.rstudio.com/bookdown/reference/bs4_book.html}

Or use:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{?bookdown}\SpecialCharTok{::}\NormalTok{bs4\_book}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}
