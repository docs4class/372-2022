# Applied Analytics Overview

**Analytics** is the systematic computational analysis of data or statistics.


::: {.rmdnote}

It is used for the discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in data. It also entails applying data patterns towards effective decision-making. 

:::

It can be valuable in areas rich with recorded information; analytics relies on the simultaneous application of statistics, computer programming and operations research to quantify performance.

Organizations may apply analytics to business data to describe, predict, and improve business performance. 

Specifically, areas within analytics include predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics, enterprise decision management, descriptive analytics, cognitive analytics, Big Data Analytics, retail analytics, supply chain analytics, store assortment and stock-keeping unit optimization, marketing optimization and marketing mix modeling, web analytics, call analytics, speech analytics, sales force sizing and optimization, price and promotion modeling, predictive science, graph analytics, credit risk analysis, and fraud analytics. 

Since analytics can require extensive computation (think: big data), the algorithms and software used for analytics harness the most current methods in computer science, statistics, and mathematics.

# Assignment 1

::: {.rmdimportant}

Let's make sure we feel good about BADM 371 material.  

All open notes/internet/R4DS/etc. but all work must be your own.

**Monday:** Wrap up previous topic and introduce what you've pre-read about.  Chat.  Play.  Work some examples.

**Wednesday:**  Work more examples.  Chat as needed.  _Live our best lives._  :).  

**Friday:** Apply what we've learned -- demonstrate your mastery (typically in the form of a quiz, lab, or assignment.  Rinse.  Repeat.
