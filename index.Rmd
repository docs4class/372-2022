# About this course

::: {.rmdimportant}

This website serves as headquarters for **BADM 372 Applied  Analytics**. 

:::


Content here will be updated with any changes made during the semester, so if at any point you are told there was a change in the schedule or an assignment, you can come here to get the updated version.

Also, this website has benefited greatly from lots of free, readily available resources posted on the web and we leverage these extensively. I would encourage you to review these resources in your analytics journey. Some that we specifically use with great frequency are these (**and I say a loud THANK YOU to the authors!**):

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
- [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](https://trevorhastie.github.io/ISLR/)
- [Data Science in a Box](https://datasciencebox.org/)
- [stackoverflow.com, for example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4862178/remove-rows-with-all-or-some-nas-missing-values-in-data-frame?rq=1)
