# About this course

This is a book written which contains serves as headquarters for **BADM 372 Intro to Applied  Analytics**. 


This book is updated automatically with any changes made to the documents during the semester, so if at any point you are told there was a change in the assignment, you can come here to get the updated version.

Also, this book has benefited greatly from lots of free, readily available resources posted on the web and we leverage these extensively. I would encourage you to review these resources in your analytics journey. Some that we specifically use with great frequency are these (and I say loud THANK YOU to the authors!):

    R for Data Science
    An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R
    Data Science in a Box
    stackoverflow.com, for example



```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
